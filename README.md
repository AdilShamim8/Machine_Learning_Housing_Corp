## Project Overview  

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates median house prices in California based on multiple features of the districts. The dataset contains important variables such as:  

- Average number of rooms  
- Population density  
- Average income  
- Proximity to amenities  

## Features  

- A dataset containing house values and relevant features.  
- Implementations of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
- Data preprocessing steps integrated into the analysis.  
- Visualization of results for better understanding.  

## Getting Started  

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine_Learning_Housing_Corp.git  
    cd Machine_Learning_Housing_Corp  
    ```  

2. **Install the necessary libraries**:  
    ```bash  
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    ```  

3. **Download the dataset** (follow instructions in `data/README.md`).  

## Usage  

To explore the analysis and use the models, open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the project:  

### Running the Notebook  

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
    ```bash  
    jupyter notebook  
    ```  

2. Open `Analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells to begin your analysis!  

## Models  

This project implements several machine learning models, including:  

- **Linear Regression**: A foundational approach for predicting outcomes.  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Enhances predictive accuracy through ensemble learning.  
- **Gradient Boosting**: Another advanced technique that improves model performance.  

## Evaluation  

Model performance is assessed using metrics such as:  

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R-squared score  

These evaluations are crucial for understanding model accuracy and reliability.
